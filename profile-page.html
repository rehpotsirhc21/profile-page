        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I work as a product owner on a scrum team. My team is responsible for clinical API development. 
            I am taking this bootcamp so that I can better communicate with my system analysts and developers as we take on more complex projects. 

        </p>

        <p> In my free time I enjoy reading and gaming. Right now I am reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Witching-Hour-Lives-Mayfair-Witches/dp/0345384466" target = "_blank">The Witching Hour</a> and recently finished <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Shaped-Box-Joe-Hill/dp/0061944890" target= "_blank">Heart Shaped Box.</a> I am currently playing through <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/" target = "_blank">Horizon Forbidden West.</a></p>
